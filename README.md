Cortex is the ultimate solution to front end development. It helps you write modular, resusable components which are not just javascript, but also includeing css, images, fonts, and .etc.

Cortex offers:
* a registry cloud for package management
* cli tool that covers everything from development to production
* let you write code in the nodejs way, just use 'require', not module wrapper needed
* smart version system with fully semantic version support
* a powerful yet simple-to-use module/resource loader

Cortex is especially sutibale for large project because it helps us break down the logic into modular pieces. It has been used in production in Dianping.com for years.

Small project could also benefit from cortex, just install our best buddy jquery, or bootstrap, then focus on the work to bring your brilliant ideal into reality!
